# DCC Decoder

## Introduction

This is an implementation of a Digital Command Control signal decoder
using an ATMEL AVR ATMega328 or an Arduino.

*THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. IT DOES CURRENTLY DECODE DCC PACKETS
 FROM A TRANSMITTER / BASE STATION BUT JUST OUTPUTS THE PACKET DATA
 VIA THE SERIAL TRANSMITTER (9600 8N1 NO HANDSHAKE)
